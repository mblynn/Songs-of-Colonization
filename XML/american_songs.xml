            <line>We are going to the <landscape>range</landscape> in which we take delight;</line>
            <line>We are going on the <landscape>range</landscape> as we <people>poor hunters</people> do,</line>

            <line>Our <weapon>guns</weapon> upon our shoulders, our belts of <weapon>forty rounds</weapon>,</line>
            <line>We send them up <place>Salt River</place> to some <landscape>happy hunting grounds</landscape>.</line>

        <verse>
            <line>Our game, it is the <animal>antelope</animal>, the <animal>buffalo</animal>, <animal>wolf</animal>, and <animal>deer</animal>,</line>
            <line>Who roam the <landscape>wide prairies</landscape> without a single fear;</line>
            <line>We <action>rob</action> him of his robe and think it is no harm,</line>

        <verse>
            <line>The <animal>buffalo</animal>, he is the noblest of the band,</line>
            <line>He sometimes rejects in throwing up his hand.</line>
            <line>His shaggy main thrown forward, his head raised to the sky,</line>
            <line>He seems to say, <dialogue>"We're coming, boys; so <people>hunter</people>, mind your eye."</dialogue></line>
        </verse>

            <line>Our fires are made of <resource>mesquite roots</resource>, our beds are on the ground;</line>
            <line>Our houses made of <animal>buffalo</animal> <resource>hides</resource>, we make them tall and round;</line>
            <line>Our furniture is the camp kettle, the coffee pot, and pan,</line>
            <line>Our chuck it is both <resource>bread</resource> and <resource>meat</resource>, mingled well with sand.</line>

            <line>Our neighbors are the <people>Cheyennes</people>, the <people>'Rapahoes</people>, and <people>Sioux</people>,</line>
            <line>Their mode of navigation is a buffalo-hide canoe.</line>
            <line>And when <action>they come upon you</action> <action>they take you</action> unaware,</line>
            <line>And such a peculiar way they have of <action>raising <people>hunter</people>'s hair</action>.</line>

            <line>It was at the age of sixteen that I joined the jolly band,</line>

<!-- Questions: should I include punctuation? Should I include descriptors within the tags? Should I tag other
peoples mentioned (ex. Chinese)? Should we include expansion/movement West/colonization/frontier as a tag? 
Look at Siuox Indians for when to tag soldier vs. col. Maybe tag for brother? See if bright homes in Old
Scout's Lament is homeland (same with homeward way in metis). See if location should also be a tag. -->
