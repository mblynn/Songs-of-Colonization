            <p class="info">Songs of Colonization is a project that analyzes a select corpus of
                US-American and German South-West African “folk songs” that highlight collective
                ideas of nationalism and colonialism during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
                After selecting our songs, our team analyzed them using XML technologies to produce
                this website and the data presented on it. </p>
            <p class="info">This project was completed during our semester-long Computational
                Methods in Humanities Course at the University of Pittsburgh by Lilly Forrest, Evan
                Ressel, and Maja Lynn. Our thanks to our professors David Birnbaum, James Pickett,
                and UTA Mitchell Luckman for all of their guidance. </p>
