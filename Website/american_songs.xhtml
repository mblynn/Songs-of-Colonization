         <h2>About the Songs</h2>
         <p>The songs that make up this Corpus were all selected from <i>Cowboy Songs and Other
               Frontier Ballads</i>,<sup><a href="#note1" class="note">1</a></sup> which was first
            published in 1910. We choose this source because it was easily accessible and was
            already digitalized on the Project Guttenberg site. We selected songs whose content
            dealt directly with either expansion and possession of land or with settlersâ€™
            relationships with native peoples. You will notice that this corpus is significantly
            larger than the German songs, this is due to multiple historical and practical reasons.
            First, we had a much easier time finding and accessing American folk songs online. The
            American period of expansion was also much longer and has been celebrated in popular
            culture to this day. This accounts for a greater public interest in these songs, which
            likely contributed to higher rates of publication and circulation. Due to the time and
            resource restrictions of this project, we embraced this disparity and went forward with
            a greater amount of American songs. </p>
