         <p>          
            Hello, I treck with a riders delight <br/>                    
            Along the path on horseback<br/>  
            My heart rejoices in my  chest,<br/>         
            Just like by <span class="sig tooltip">
               <span class="positive">my mother’s hearth</span>
            </span>
            <br/> 
            it knows no worries, it knows no suffering<br/>
             No rider ever worries<br/>
            And yet I ask with longing:<br/>
            <span class="homeland  tooltip">
               <span class="positive">When will I return home?</span>
            </span>
         </p>
         <p>
            I ride along the road<br/> 
            In bright sunshine<br/> 
            My song rings through the blue ether<br/> 
            And out into the bush<br/>
            it carries the song to the whole world,<br/>
            what fills my heart <br/>
            But mark this, I don’t like any song<br/>
            That is not meant for my loved one 
        </p>
         <p>
            The kudu and the wildebeest,<br/>
            The gemsbock and the ostrich, <br/>
            I scare them out of their nest<br/> 
            And shoot them <span class="possess  tooltip">
               <span class="resource">for my feast</span>
            </span>
            <br/>

            And yet I only long for <br/>
            My love
        </p>
         <p> 
            Through mountains and valleys up and down<br/>
            I ride away and away,<br/>
            Up and down, in walk and trot <br/>
            Is how I go from place from place<br/>
            I do not shy away from the gallop, <br/>
            Free lies the road before me!<br/>
            and when <span class="homeland  tooltip">
               <span class="positive">my homeland</span>
