        <title>THE BUFFALO HUNTERS</title>
        <verse>
            <line>Come all you <woman positive="beauty">pretty girls</woman>, to you these lines I'll write,</line>
            <line>We are going to the range in which we take delight;</line>
            <line>We are going on the range as we <people negative>poor hunters</people> do,</line>
            <line>And the tender-footed fellows can stay at home with you.</line>
        </verse>
        <verse>
            <line>It's all of the day long as we go tramping round</line>
            <line>In search of the <animal>buffalo</animal> that we may shoot him down;</line>
            <line>Our guns upon our shoulders, our belts of forty rounds,</line>
            <line>We send them up Salt River to some <landscape positive>happy hunting grounds</landscape>.</line>
        </verse>
        <verse>
            <line>Our game, it is the <animal>antelope</animal>, the <animal>buffalo</animal>, <animal>wolf</animal>, and <animal>deer</animal>,</line>
            <line>Who roam the <landscape>wide prairies</landscape> without a single fear;</line>
            <line>We rob him of his robe and think it is no harm,</line>
            <line>To buy us food and clothing to keep our bodies warm.</line>
        </verse>
        <verse>
            <line>The <animal>buffalo</animal>, he is the noblest of the band,</line>
            <line>He sometimes rejects in throwing up his hand.</line>
            <line>His shaggy main thrown forward, his head raised to the sky,</line>
            <line>He seems to say, "We're coming, boys; so <person>hunter</person>, mind your eye."</line>
        </verse>
        <verse>
            <line>Our fires are made of mesquite roots, our beds are on the ground;</line>
            <line>Our houses made of buffalo hides, we make them tall and round;</line>
            <line>Our furniture is the camp kettle, the coffee pot, and pan,</line>
            <line>Our chuck it is both bread and meat, mingled well with sand.</line>
        </verse>
        <verse>
            <line>Our neighbors are the <col>Cheyennes</col>, the <col>'Rapahoes</col>, and <col>Sioux</col>,</line>
            <line>Their mode of navigation is a buffalo-hide canoe.</line>
            <line>And when they come upon you <action>they take you</action> unaware,</line>
            <line>And such a peculiar way they have of raising <person>hunter</person>'s hair.</line>

        <verse>
            <line>Now, <god>O Lord</god>, please lend me thine ear,</line>
            <line>The prayer of a <person>cattleman</person> to hear,</line>
            <line>No doubt the prayers may seem strange,</line>
            <line>But I want you to bless our <landscape>cattle range</landscape>.</line>

        <verse>
            <line>Bless the round-ups year by year,</line>

            <line>Water the lands with brooks and rills</line>
            <line>For my <animal>cattle</animal> that roam on a <landscape>thousand hills</landscape>.</line>

            <line>Let thunder roll and water drop.</line>
            <line>It frightens me to see the smoke;</line>
            <line>Unless it's stopped, I'll go dead broke.</line>

            <line>As you, <god>O Lord</god>, my <animal>herd</animal> behold,</line>
            <line>It represents a sack of <money>gold</money>;</line>
            <line>I think at least five cents a pound</line>
            <line>Will be the price of beef the year around.</line>
        </verse>
        <verse>
            <line>One thing more and then I'm through,--</line>
            <line>Instead of one <animal>calf</animal>, give my <animal>cows</animal> two.</line>
            <line>I may pray different from other men</line>
            <line>But I've had my say, and now, Amen.</line>

        <title>TEXAS RANGERS</title>
        <verse>
            <line>Come, all you <people>Texas rangers</people>, wherever you may be,</line>
            <line>I'll tell you of some <negative>troubles</negative> that happened unto me.</line>
            <line>My name is nothing extra, so it I will not tell,--</line>
            <line>And here's to all you rangers, I am sure I wish you well.</line>
        </verse>
        <verse>
            <line>It was at the age of sixteen that I joined the jolly band,</line>
            <line>We marched from <place>San Antonio</place> down to the <place>Rio Grande</place>.</line>
            <line>Our <person>captain</person> he informed us, perhaps he thought it right,</line>
            <line>"Before we reach the station, boys, you'll surely have to <action>fight</action>."</line>
        </verse>
        <verse>
            <line>And when the bugle sounded our captain gave command,</line>
            <line>"To arms, to arms," he shouted, "and by your horses stand."</line>
            <line>I saw the smoke ascending, it seemed to reach the sky;</line>
            <line>The first thought that struck me, my time had come to die.</line>
        </verse>
        <verse>
            <line>I saw the <col>Indians</col> coming, I heard them <action>give the yell</action>;</line>
            <line>My feelings at that moment, no tongue can ever tell.</line>
            <line>I saw the glittering lances, their arrows round me flew,</line>
            <line>And all my strength it left me and all my courage too.</line>
        </verse>
        <verse>
            <line>We <action>fought</action> full nine hours before the strife was o'er,</line>
            <line>The like of <negative>dead and wounded</negative> I never saw before.</line>
            <line>And when the sun was rising and the <col>Indians</col> they had fled,</line>
            <line>We loaded up our rifles and counted up our dead.</line>
        </verse>
        <verse>
            <line>And all of us were <negative>wounded</negative>, our noble captain <negative>slain</negative>,</line>
            <line>And the sun was shining sadly across the <landscape negative>bloody plain</landscape>.</line>
            <line>Sixteen as brave rangers as ever roamed the <place>West</place></line>
            <line>Were buried by their comrades with arrows in their breast.</line>
        </verse>
        <verse>
            <line>'Twas then I thought of <woman>mother</woman>, who to me in tears did say,</line>
            <line>"To you they are all strangers, with me you had better stay."</line>
            <line>I thought that she was childish, the best she did not know;</line>
            <line>My mind was fixed on ranging and I was bound to go.</line>
        </verse>
        <verse>
            <line>Perhaps you have a <person>mother</person>, likewise a <person>sister</person> too,</line>
            <line>And maybe you have a <person>sweetheart</person> to weep and mourn for you;</line>
            <line>If that be your situation, although you'd like to <action>roam</action>,</line>
            <line>I'd advise you by experience, you had better stay at home.</line>
        </verse>
        <verse>
            <line>I have seen the fruits of rambling, I know its <negative>hardships</negative> well;</line>
            <line>I have crossed the <place>Rocky Mountains</place>, rode down the streets of hell;</line>
            <line>I have been in the great <place>Southwest</place> where the wild <col>Apaches</col> roam,</line>
            <line>And I tell you from experience you had better stay at home.</line>
        </verse>
        <verse>
            <line>And now my song is ended; I guess I have sung enough;</line>
            <line>The life of a <person>ranger</person> I am sure is <negative>very tough</negative>.</line>
            <line>And here's to all you <woman>ladies</woman>, I am sure I wish you well,</line>
            <line>I am bound to go a-ranging, so <person>ladies</person>, fare you well.</line>

            <line>Come all of you, my brother scouts,</line>
            <line>And join me in my song;</line>
            <line>Come, let us sing together</line>
            <line>Though the shadows fall so long.</line>
        </verse>
        <verse>
            <line>Of all the old frontiersmen</line>
            <line>That used to scour the plain,</line>
            <line>There are but very few of them</line>
            <line>That with us yet remain.</line>
        </verse>
        <verse>
            <line>Day after day they're dropping off,</line>
            <line>They're going one by one;</line>
            <line>Our clan is fast decreasing,</line>
            <line>Our race is almost run.</line>
        </verse>
        <verse>
            <line>There were many of our number</line>
            <line>That never wore the blue,</line>
            <line>But, faithfully, they did their part,</line>
            <line>As brave men, tried and true.</line>
        </verse>
        <verse>
            <line>They never joined the army,</line>
            <line>But had other work to do</line>
            <line>In piloting the coming folks,</line>
            <line>To help them safely through.</line>
        </verse>
        <verse>
            <line>But, brothers, we are falling,</line>
            <line>Our race is almost run;</line>
            <line>The days of elk and buffalo</line>
            <line>And beaver traps are gone.</line>
        </verse>
        <verse>
            <line>Oh the days of elk and buffalo</line>
            <line>It fills my heart with pain</line>
            <line>To know these days are past and gone</line>
            <line>To never come again.</line>
        </verse>
        <verse>
            <line>We fought the red-skin rascals</line>
            <line>Over valley, hill, and plain;</line>
            <line>We fought him in the mountain top,</line>
            <line>And fought him down again.</line>
        </verse>
        <verse>
            <line>These fighting days are over;</line>
            <line>The Indian yell resounds</line>
            <line>No more along the border;</line>
            <line>Peace sends far sweeter sounds.</line>
        </verse>
        <verse>
            <line>But we found great joy, old comrades</line>
            <line>To hear, and make it die;</line>
            <line>We won bright homes for gentle ones,</line>
            <line>And now, our West, good-bye.</line>
