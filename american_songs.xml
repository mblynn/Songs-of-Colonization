        <title>THE BUFFALO HUNTERS</title>
        <verse>
            <line>Come all you pretty girls, to you these lines I'll write,</line>
            <line>We are going to the range in which we take delight;</line>
            <line>We are going on the range as we poor hunters do,</line>
            <line>And the tender-footed fellows can stay at home with you.</line>
        </verse>
        <verse>
            <line>It's all of the day long as we go tramping round</line>
            <line>In search of the buffalo that we may shoot him down;</line>
            <line>Our guns upon our shoulders, our belts of forty rounds,</line>
            <line>We send them up Salt River to some happy hunting grounds.</line>
        </verse>
        <verse>
            <line>Our game, it is the antelope, the buffalo, wolf, and deer,</line>
            <line>Who roam the wide prairies without a single fear;</line>
            <line>We rob him of his robe and think it is no harm,</line>
            <line>To buy us food and clothing to keep our bodies warm.</line>
        </verse>
        <verse>
            <line>The buffalo, he is the noblest of the band,</line>
            <line>He sometimes rejects in throwing up his hand.</line>
            <line>His shaggy main thrown forward, his head raised to the sky,</line>
            <line>He seems to say, "We're coming, boys; so hunter, mind your eye."</line>
        </verse>
        <verse>
            <line>Our fires are made of mesquite roots, our beds are on the ground;</line>
            <line>Our houses made of buffalo hides, we make them tall and round;</line>
            <line>Our furniture is the camp kettle, the coffee pot, and pan,</line>
            <line>Our chuck it is both bread and meat, mingled well with sand.</line>
        </verse>
        <verse>
            <line>Our neighbors are the Cheyennes, the 'Rapahoes, and Sioux,</line>
            <line>Their mode of navigation is a buffalo-hide canoe.</line>
            <line>And when they come upon you they take you unaware,</line>
            <line>And such a peculiar way they have of raising hunter's hair.</line>

        <title>THE COWMAN'S PRAYER</title>
        <verse>
            <line>Now, O Lord, please lend me thine ear,</line>
            <line>The prayer of a cattleman to hear,</line>
            <line>No doubt the prayers may seem strange,</line>
            <line>But I want you to bless our cattle range.</line>
        </verse>
        <verse>
            <line>Bless the round-ups year by year,</line>
            <line>And don't forget the growing steer;</line>
            <line>Water the lands with brooks and rills</line>
            <line>For my cattle that roam on a thousand hills.</line>
        </verse>
        <verse>
            <line>Prairie fires, won't you please stop?</line>
            <line>Let thunder roll and water drop.</line>
            <line>It frightens me to see the smoke;</line>
            <line>Unless it's stopped, I'll go dead broke.</line>
        </verse>
        <verse>
            <line>As you, O Lord, my herd behold,</line>
            <line>It represents a sack of gold;</line>
            <line>I think at least five cents a pound</line>
            <line>Will be the price of beef the year around.</line>
        </verse>
        <verse>
            <line>One thing more and then I'm through,--</line>
            <line>Instead of one calf, give my cows two.</line>
            <line>I may pray different from other men</line>
            <line>But I've had my say, and now, Amen.</line>

        <title>HERE'S TO THE RANGER!</title>
        <verse>
            <line>He leaves unplowed his furrow,</line>
            <line>He leaves his books unread</line>
            <line>For a life of tented freedom</line>
            <line>By lure of danger led.</line>
            <line>He's first in the hour of peril,</line>
            <line>He's gayest in the dance,</line>
            <line>Like the guardsman of old England</line>
            <line>Or the beau sabreur of France.</line>
        </verse>
        <verse>
            <line>He stands our faithful bulwark</line>
            <line>Against our savage foe;</line>
            <line>Through lonely woodland places</line>
            <line>Our children come and go;</line>
            <line>Our flocks and herds untended</line>
            <line>O'er hill and valley roam,</line>
            <line>The Ranger in the saddle</line>
            <line>Means peace for us at home.</line>
        </verse>
        <verse>
            <line>Behold our smiling farmsteads</line>
            <line>Where waves the golden grain!</line>
            <line>Beneath yon tree, earth's bosom</line>
            <line>Was dark with crimson stain.</line>
            <line>That bluff the death-shot echoed</line>
            <line>Of husband, father, slain!</line>
            <line>God grant such sight of horror</line>
            <line>We never see again!</line>
        </verse>
        <verse>
            <line>The gay and hardy Ranger,</line>
            <line>His blanket on the ground,</line>
            <line>Lies by the blazing camp-fire</line>
            <line>While song and tale goes round;</line>
            <line>And if one voice is silent,</line>
            <line>One fails to hear the jest,</line>
            <line>They know his thoughts are absent</line>
            <line>With her who loves him best.</line>
        </verse>
        <verse>
            <line>Our state, her sons confess it,</line>
            <line>That queenly, star-crowned brow,</line>
            <line>Has darkened with the shadow</line>
            <line>Of lawlessness ere now;</line>
            <line>And men of evil passions</line>
            <line>On her reproach have laid,</line>
            <line>But that the ready Ranger</line>
            <line>Rode promptly to her aid.</line>
        </verse>
        <verse>
            <line>He may not win the laurel</line>
            <line>Nor trumpet tongue of fame;</line>
            <line>But beauty smiles upon him,</line>
            <line>And ranchmen bless his name.</line>
            <line>Then here's to the Texas Ranger,</line>
            <line>Past, present and to come!</line>
            <line>Our safety from the savage,</line>
            <line>The guardian of our home.</line>

        <title>TEXAS RANGERS</title>
        <verse>
            <line>Come, all you Texas rangers, wherever you may be,</line>
            <line>I'll tell you of some troubles that happened unto me.</line>
            <line>My name is nothing extra, so it I will not tell,--</line>
            <line>And here's to all you rangers, I am sure I wish you well.</line>
        </verse>
        <verse>
            <line>It was at the age of sixteen that I joined the jolly band,</line>
            <line>We marched from San Antonio down to the Rio Grande.</line>
            <line>Our captain he informed us, perhaps he thought it right,</line>
            <line>"Before we reach the station, boys, you'll surely have to fight."</line>
        </verse>
        <verse>
            <line>And when the bugle sounded our captain gave command,</line>
            <line>"To arms, to arms," he shouted, "and by your horses stand."</line>
            <line>I saw the smoke ascending, it seemed to reach the sky;</line>
            <line>The first thought that struck me, my time had come to die.</line>
        </verse>
        <verse>
            <line>I saw the Indians coming, I heard them give the yell;</line>
            <line>My feelings at that moment, no tongue can ever tell.</line>
            <line>I saw the glittering lances, their arrows round me flew,</line>
            <line>And all my strength it left me and all my courage too.</line>
        </verse>
        <verse>
            <line>We fought full nine hours before the strife was o'er,</line>
            <line>The like of dead and wounded I never saw before.</line>
            <line>And when the sun was rising and the Indians they had fled,</line>
            <line>We loaded up our rifles and counted up our dead.</line>
        </verse>
        <verse>
            <line>And all of us were wounded, our noble captain slain,</line>
            <line>And the sun was shining sadly across the bloody plain.</line>
            <line>Sixteen as brave rangers as ever roamed the West</line>
            <line>Were buried by their comrades with arrows in their breast.</line>
        </verse>
        <verse>
            <line>'Twas then I thought of mother, who to me in tears did say,</line>
            <line>"To you they are all strangers, with me you had better stay."</line>
            <line>I thought that she was childish, the best she did not know;</line>
            <line>My mind was fixed on ranging and I was bound to go.</line>
        </verse>
        <verse>
            <line>Perhaps you have a mother, likewise a sister too,</line>
            <line>And maybe you have a sweetheart to weep and mourn for you;</line>
            <line>If that be your situation, although you'd like to roam,</line>
            <line>I'd advise you by experience, you had better stay at home.</line>
        </verse>
        <verse>
            <line>I have seen the fruits of rambling, I know its hardships well;</line>
            <line>I have crossed the Rocky Mountains, rode down the streets of hell;</line>
            <line>I have been in the great Southwest where the wild Apaches roam,</line>
            <line>And I tell you from experience you had better stay at home.</line>
        </verse>
        <verse>
            <line>And now my song is ended; I guess I have sung enough;</line>
            <line>The life of a ranger I am sure is very tough.</line>
            <line>And here's to all you ladies, I am sure I wish you well,</line>
            <line>I am bound to go a-ranging, so ladies, fare you well.</line>
