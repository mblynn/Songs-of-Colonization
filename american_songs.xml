        <verse>
            <line>Come all you <woman>pretty girls</woman>, to you these lines I'll write,</line>
            <line>We are going to the <landscape>range</landscape> in which we take delight;</line>
            <line>We are going on the <landscape>range</landscape> as we <people>poor hunters</people> do,</line>
            <line>And the tender-footed fellows can stay at home with you.</line>
        </verse>
        <verse>
            <line>It's all of the day long as we go tramping round</line>
            <line>In search of the <animal>buffalo</animal> that we may <action>shoot</action> him down;</line>
            <line>Our <weapon>guns</weapon> upon our shoulders, our belts of <weapon>forty rounds</weapon>,</line>
            <line>We send them up <place>Salt River</place> to some <landscape>happy hunting grounds</landscape>.</line>
        </verse>
        <verse>
            <line>Our game, it is the <animal>antelope</animal>, the <animal>buffalo</animal>, <animal>wolf</animal>, and <animal>deer</animal>,</line>
            <line>Who roam the <landscape>wide prairies</landscape> without a single fear;</line>
            <line>We <action>rob</action> him of his robe and think it is no harm,</line>
            <line>To buy us food and clothing to keep our bodies warm.</line>
        </verse>
        <verse>
            <line>The <animal>buffalo</animal>, he is the noblest of the band,</line>
            <line>He sometimes rejects in throwing up his hand.</line>
            <line>His shaggy main thrown forward, his head raised to the sky,</line>
            <line>He seems to say, <dialogue>"We're coming, boys; so <person>hunter</person>, mind your eye."</dialogue></line>
        </verse>
        <verse>
            <line>Our fires are made of mesquite roots, our beds are on the ground;</line>
            <line>Our houses made of <animal>buffalo</animal> hides, we make them tall and round;</line>
            <line>Our furniture is the camp kettle, the coffee pot, and pan,</line>
            <line>Our chuck it is both bread and meat, mingled well with sand.</line>
        </verse>
        <verse>
            <line>Our neighbors are the <col>Cheyennes</col>, the <col>'Rapahoes</col>, and <col>Sioux</col>,</line>
            <line>Their mode of navigation is a buffalo-hide canoe.</line>
            <line>And when they come upon you <action>they take you</action> unaware,</line>
            <line>And such a peculiar way they have of raising <person>hunter</person>'s hair.</line>

            <line>I think at least five cents a pound</line>
            <line>Will be the price of <animal>beef</animal> the year around.</line>

        <verse>
            <line>One thing more and then I'm through,--</line>

            <line>But I've had my say, and now, Amen.</line>

            <line>I'll tell you of some <hardship>troubles</hardship> that happened unto me.</line>

        <verse>
            <line>It was at the age of sixteen that I joined the jolly band,</line>
            <line>We marched from <place>San Antonio</place> down to the <place>Rio Grande</place>.</line>
            <line>Our <person>captain</person> he informed us, perhaps he thought it right,</line>

        </verse>
        <verse>
            <line>And when the bugle sounded our <person>captain</person> <action>gave command</action>,</line>
            <line><dialogue>"To arms, to arms,"</dialogue> he shouted, <dialogue>"and by your horses stand."</dialogue></line>
            <line>I saw the smoke ascending, it seemed to reach the sky;</line>
            <line>The first thought that struck me, my time had come to <death>die</death>.</line>

            <line>I saw the <col>Indians</col> coming, I heard them <action>give the yell</action>;</line>
            <line>My feelings at that moment, no tongue can ever tell.</line>
            <line>I saw the glittering <weapon>lances</weapon>, their <weapon>arrows</weapon> round me flew,</line>
            <line>And all my strength it left me and all my courage too.</line>
        </verse>
        <verse>
            <line>We <action>fought</action> full nine hours before the strife was o'er,</line>

            <line>And all of us were wounded, our noble <person>captain</person> <negative>slain</negative>,</line>

            <line>Sixteen as brave <person>rangers</person> as ever roamed the <place>West</place></line>
            <line>Were buried by their <person>comrades</person> with <weapon>arrows</weapon> in their breast.</line>

<!-- Questions: should I include punctuation? Should I include descriptors within the tags? Should I tag other
peoples mentioned (ex. Chinese)? Should we include expansion/movement West/colonization/frontier as a tag? 
Look at Siuox Indians for when to tag soldier vs. col. Maybe tag for brother? See if bright homes in Old
Scout's Lament is homeland (same with homeward way in metis). See if location should also be a tag. -->
